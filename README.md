## Installation

1. It is recommended that you experiment with this project by creating a `new environment` and then downloading requirements.txt using the command:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. In order to use the GPT-Sovits model, you can download the model file at the following `QuarkNet link`, and put the entire downloaded file into the `model` folder:
    ```sh
    link:.....
    ```
3. Now you can start running our project! First of all you need to run `model/GPT-Sovits/api2.py` in your operating environment and `keep the process running`:
    ```sh
    cd model/GPT-Sovits/
    ```
    then
    ```sh
    python api2.py
    ```
4. Finally, you just need to go back to the `root directory` and run the `main.py` file, and then you can follow the front-end interface yourself!:
    ```sh
    cd ..(twice)
    ```
    then
    ```sh
    python main.py
